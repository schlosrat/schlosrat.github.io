# KSP2 Modding Articles
This part of the API Documentation site contains articles on how to contribute to the site so that you can help make it a better and more useful resource to KSP2 modders. The minimal set of articles you should expect to find here are the following.

[Adding/Editing Articles](AddArticles.md) covers how to add and edit articles here on this site
[Adding Documenting (XML) Comments to Code](AddCodeComments.md) covers what you need to do to be able to add or edit the XML code documentation included in this site. Note that the Assembly-CSharp.xml file that's generated based on the documenting comments can also be used in your development environemnt to enable intellisense comments for KSP2 types, methods, and objects.

See the [KSP2 Modding Wiki](https://wiki.spacewarp.org/wiki/Main_Page) for a lot more information relevant to modding KSP2. There you will find guides on [Getting Started](https://wiki.spacewarp.org/wiki/Category:Getting_started), [Parts Modding](https://wiki.spacewarp.org/wiki/Category:Parts_modding), and other useful topics that are beyond the scope of this site.

The [SpaceWarp Mod Template](https://github.com/SpaceWarpDev/SpaceWarp.Template) is also a valuable resource that can help get you going with makeing mods for KSP2.
